# Relat√≥rio Sprint G - States of Project

## 1. Introduction


During my time on the project, I contributed to the team from Sprint A to Sprint C, playing a role in creating documentation and tests for various User Stories. In Sprint A, I worked on User Story 004, "Vote on a post", while in Sprint B, I focussed on API documentation and implementing tests for the set of functional backend endpoints, including functionalities such as Logout, upvote and downvote on comments. In Sprint C, I took part in resolving problems identified in "BuggedStories.md", such as the incorrect ordering of posts (User Story 01).

From Sprint D onwards, I opted to move forward independently, seeking to take on more responsibilities to strengthen my learning, which until then I considered to be at an early stage. I took on a new role in the project, now in Group 5, assuming full responsibility for the next sprints, from Sprint D to the current Sprint G. This change allowed me to dive deeper into the demands of the project and work with a new repository, challenging me to grow as an individual while facing the challenges of these subsequent sprints.

**Proposed Tasks:**
  1. SprintA: Creation of Us Vote on a post, documentation, test description and SSD
  2. SprintB: API documentation and test implementation for the entire set of functional backend endpoints, including functionalities such as logout, upvote and downvote on comments.
  3. SprintC: Resolution of problems identified in "BuggedStories.md", such as the incorrect ordering of posts (User Story 01).
  4. SprintD: Creation of new post filter functionality (Unpopular) to bring up the least popular posts in ascending order; use of formatting tools such as prettier.
  5. SprintE: Creation of new functionality to check the average number of comments on a specific date; creation of a statistics page for this functionality on the frontend, Use of automation tests with cucumber and WebdriveIO.
  6. SprintF: Creation of new functionality to put popular posts with a date of more than five days in red, carry out tests with the Jmeter tool and make statistical reports, carry out automation tests and the use of black box criteria, methodology for commits with tags.
  7. SprintG: Prepare reports on the current and final status of the project, create a new feature if possible; use Eslint to configure the code.

  
**Tasks Performed:**
  1. SprintA: All tasks.
  2. SprintB: All tasks.
  3. SprintC: The task wasn't carried out by me, but it was completed.
  4. SprintD: Documenting the US, starting backend and frontend compilation, configuring the prettier tool.
  5. SprintE: US documentation, Gherkin documentation, start of compilation between backend and frontend, creation of statistics page, start of automation tests.
  6. SprintF: Created documentation for the new functionality; no changes were made to the backend; on the frontend, the task was carried out by searching for the css selector, postmetapopular.tsx and postmetapopular.sass files were created; jmeter tests were carried out (for 10, 50, 100 and 200 users) and automation tests were carried out for this functionality (use of threshold values - black box).
  7. SprintG: In progress
  

**Pending Tasks:**
  1. SprintA: No pending tasks.
  2. SprintB: No pending tasks.
  3. SprintC: No pending tasks.
  4. SprintD: API testing, finalising backend and frontend.
  5. SprintE: API testing, finalising backend and frontend, working on, correcting frontend methods for statistics pages, correcting automated tests.
  6. SprintF: Smoke test pass, test more black box criteria.
  7. SprintG: Final report.

**Tasks carried out in the next sprint (Yes/No if yes, which ones?)**
  1. SprintA: No.
  2. SprintB: No.
  3. SprintC: No.
  4. SprintD: Yes. Finalised backend and frontend corrections, functional filter in the interface (task finalised in sprintF).
  5. SprintE: Yes. Finalised backend and frontend corrections for page statistics functionality (task finalised in sprintF).
  6. SprintF: Yes. In progress.
  7. SprintG: In progress.

**Plan for Corrections:**
  1. SprintA: No.
  2. SprintB: No.
  3. SprintC: No.
  4. SprintD: Working on API tests (running).
  5. SprintE: Work on API tests and automated tests (running).
  6. SprintF: Work on all the repository documentation to display the coverage tests; Carry out commits as requested.
  7. SprintG: In progress.

## 2. Plan for Fixes until 20 December

**API Tests and Automated Tests**

**Task:** Develop API tests to cover outstanding functionality
**Strategy:**
Identify the critical areas of the application that need API testing.
Use tools such as Postman or Jest to create automated tests for the API.

**Timeline:**
By 13 December: Identification of the critical areas.
By 15 December: Development of API tests.
By 18 December: Review and execution of the tests.

**Repository Documentation and Coverage Tests:**

**Task:** Revise all the repository documentation to display the coverage tests.
**Strategy:**
Use a coverage reporting tool to measure test coverage.
Integrate the coverage reports into the repository documentation.
**Timeline:**
By 16 December: Test execution and report generation.
By 19 December: Integration of the reports into the repository documentation.

**Commits carried out as requested:**

**Task:** Ensure the proper realisation of commits as requested.
**Strategy:**
Review good commit practices (clear message).
Ensure that each commit has a specific and meaningful purpose.
**Timeline:**
By 20 December: Review all previous commits and adjust if necessary.

**Review and Delivery:**

**Strategy:**
Carry out constant progress reviews to ensure compliance with the plan.
Carry out final tests to ensure the effectiveness of the corrections and improvements made.
**Timeline:**
By 20 December: Final review and preparation for delivery.

**Final Delivery:**

**Strategy:**
Ensure that all corrections and improvements are completed and properly documented.
Have the delivery marked as "final-version" in the project repositories.
**Timeline:**
Final Delivery: 21 December

## 3. Decision on New Features

As I am currently working independently on the project, after a careful analysis of the established plan and the outstanding tasks from the previous sprints, it is my assessment that I do not have the necessary time to implement new features by the due date for the final sprint, which is 20 December.

Considering the current scope of outstanding tasks and individual capacity for execution, there is a priority commitment to completing the remaining outstanding tasks from previous sprints. These tasks require attention and completion to ensure the stability and integrity of the project.

Therefore, due to the need to focus on resolving unfinished tasks and correcting problems identified in previous sprints, it will not be feasible to include new functionalities in the final sprint, as this would jeopardise the quality and delivery time of existing functionalities.
